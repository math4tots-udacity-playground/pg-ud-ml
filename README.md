Using Python3

## Installation notes

Had to pip install
  sklearn
  numpy
  scipy

I was surprised that sklearn didn't bring in numpy and scipy as dependencies.

Actually http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html might shed some light here:
    We donâ€™t recommend installing scipy or numpy using pip on linux
